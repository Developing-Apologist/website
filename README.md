## About The Project

The Developing Apologist exists to equip Christian software developers with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to defend their faith in professional and personal contexts. We believe that the analytical thinking, systematic problem-solving, and evidence-based approaches that make you an effective developer also make you uniquely qualified to engage with apologetics.

### Key Features
- **Developer-Focused Content**: Training materials that speak your language using analogies from software development
- **Logical Rigor**: Evidence-based approaches that mirror your debugging and problem-solving process
- **Practical Application**: Real-world scenarios you'll encounter in the tech industry
- **Community Building**: Connecting Christian developers who can support each other

## Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Theme**: Visual Studio Code Darcula color scheme
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (via GitHub Actions)
