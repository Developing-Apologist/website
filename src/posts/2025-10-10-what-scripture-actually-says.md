# What Scripture Actually Says

*This is Part 3 of our series "Faith Isn't a Syntax Error - A Developer's Guide to Faith and Reason." [Read the series introduction here](/posts/2025-09-26-faith-isnt-syntax-error-series/).*

Faith in Scripture is never presented as blind or irrational. The Bible consistently calls us to think deeply, weigh evidence, and ground our trust in reality. Let's explore what Scripture actually says about the relationship between faith and reason.

## The Definition of Faith: Hebrews 11:1

Hebrews 11:1 gives us the clearest biblical definition of faith:

**Hebrews 11:1 (NKJV)**  
> "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

Notice that faith has both **substance**—a firm foundation—and **evidence**—reason to trust even in what we cannot fully see. This isn't blind belief; it's confident trust based on evidence.

Charles Spurgeon put it this way:  
> "Faith is not a blind thing, for faith begins with knowledge. It is not a speculative thing, for faith believes facts of which it is sure. It is not an unpractical, dreamy thing, for faith trusts, and stakes its destiny upon the truth of revelation."

Spurgeon reminds us that biblical faith is rooted in knowledge and evidence, not fantasy. John Calvin echoed this, describing faith as *"a warm embrace of Christ, by which He dwells in us and we in Him. It is founded upon the Word of God, not upon the fancies of men."* Faith is relational, yes, but it is also grounded in revealed truth.

## God's Invitation to Reason: Isaiah 1:18

Isaiah records God's invitation to reasoning:

**Isaiah 1:18 (NKJV)**  
> "Come now, and let us reason together," Says the Lord,  
> "Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow;  
> Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool."

The Lord does not bypass reason; He appeals to it. As Matthew Henry observed, *"God will not appeal to men to take His word only, but will reason with them, that He may the more deeply convince them."* Faith is not irrational submission—it is reason carried to its fullest when we see our need for grace.

This is remarkable. The God of the universe doesn't say, "Just trust me blindly." He says, "Let's think this through together." He invites us to use our minds to understand His truth.

## The Great Commandment: Matthew 22:37

Jesus takes this even further in His command to love God with every faculty we have:

**Matthew 22:37 (NKJV)**  
> "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."

Faith involves the heart (trust), the soul (obedience), and the mind (reason). To separate faith from reason is to strip away one of the very ways God calls us to love Him. Augustine captured this balance beautifully: *"I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe."*

Notice that Jesus doesn't say "love God with your heart and soul, but leave your mind out of it." He specifically includes the mind as one of the ways we're called to love God.

## The Call to Apologetics: 1 Peter 3:15

Peter commands believers to be ready to give a reasoned defense:

**1 Peter 3:15 (NKJV)**  
> "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear."

The Greek word for "defense" here is *apologia*, meaning a reasoned explanation or logical argument. This is where we get the term "apologetics." Peter isn't calling us to emotional outbursts or blind assertions—he's calling us to thoughtful, reasoned explanations of our faith.

## Paul's Example: Acts 17:2-3

Paul modeled this approach in his ministry:

**Acts 17:2-3 (NKJV)**  
> "Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, 'This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.'"

Paul didn't just make emotional appeals or ask people to take his word for it. He reasoned with them, explaining and demonstrating his claims from Scripture. He used logic and evidence to make his case.

## The Bereans: Acts 17:11

The Bereans are commended for their approach to testing Paul's message:

**Acts 17:11 (NKJV)**  
> "These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so."

The Bereans didn't just accept Paul's teaching blindly. They tested it against Scripture, searching daily to verify whether what he said was true. This is exactly the kind of thoughtful, evidence-based approach that Scripture commends.

## The Harmony of Faith and Reason

These passages and many others affirm that faith and reason are not enemies but allies. Biblical faith:

- **Begins with knowledge** (Hebrews 11:1)
- **Invites reasoning** (Isaiah 1:18)
- **Engages the mind** (Matthew 22:37)
- **Provides evidence** (1 Peter 3:15)
- **Welcomes testing** (Acts 17:11)

## Historical Support

This harmony of faith and reason is not a modern invention. Throughout church history, great thinkers have affirmed this balance:

- **Anselm of Canterbury** (1033–1109) described theology as *"faith seeking understanding,"* affirming that belief motivates deeper reasoning.
- **Thomas Aquinas** (1225–1274) taught that reason and revelation both come from God, so they cannot truly contradict each other.
- **Augustine of Hippo** (354–430) summarized the relationship as: *"I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe."*

## The Bottom Line

Together, these passages and voices affirm that faith is not a syntax error in logic—it is reason fulfilled in trust. Biblical faith invites the believer to think deeply, to love fully, and to act confidently on the evidence of God's promises.

Faith isn't about turning off your brain; it's about using your brain to its fullest capacity. It's not about believing without evidence; it's about believing based on the best evidence available.

The Bible never asks us to check our minds at the door. Instead, it calls us to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind—including the reasoning, analytical, evidence-weighing mind that makes us who we are.
