# Putting It Into Practice

*This is Part 5 of our series "Faith Isn't a Syntax Error - A Developer's Guide to Faith and Reason." [Read the series introduction here](/posts/2025-09-26-faith-isnt-syntax-error-series/).*

Now that we've explored the relationship between faith and reason, it's time to put these concepts into practice. Here are some hands-on exercises designed specifically for developers to help you apply these principles in real conversations and situations.

## Exercise 1: The Trust Reflection

**Objective**: Understand how trust works in your professional life and how it relates to faith.

**Instructions**:
Think about the systems, frameworks, or libraries you use every day as a developer. You don't see their inner workings, and you may not even fully understand them, but you trust them because they've proven reliable.

**Reflection Questions**:
1. What are three systems or tools you trust without fully understanding their internals?
2. What evidence convinced you to trust them initially?
3. How has that trust been validated over time?
4. What would it take for you to lose trust in them?

**Application to Faith**:
- How is that trust similar to faith?
- How is it different?
- What evidence supports your trust in God?
- How has that trust been validated in your life?

**Example Response**:
"I trust React because it's widely used, well-documented, and has a strong community. I don't understand every line of code, but I've seen it work reliably in production. Similarly, I trust God because of the historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection, the fulfilled prophecy in Scripture, and the transformation I've seen in my own life and others' lives."

## Exercise 2: The Doubt Journal

**Objective**: Process moments of doubt through the lens of reason and evidence.

**Instructions**:
Write about a moment when you struggled with doubt—whether intellectual, emotional, or situational. This could be about your faith, your career, or any other area of life.

**Journaling Prompts**:
1. What specific doubts did you have?
2. What evidence or reasoning helped you move forward?
3. What role did faith play in carrying you through?
4. Looking back, how do you see reason and faith working together?

**Example Entry**:
"Last year, I was laid off from my job and started doubting whether God was really in control. I felt like my faith was being tested. But as I looked back at my life, I could see patterns of God's provision—times when doors closed and better ones opened. The evidence of His faithfulness in the past gave me reason to trust Him for the future. It wasn't blind faith; it was reasoned trust based on historical evidence."

## Exercise 3: The Two-Minute Response

**Objective**: Practice articulating the relationship between faith and reason in a concise, compelling way.

**Instructions**:
Imagine a coworker says: *"Faith is just believing in fairy tales. I only trust what can be proven."* Draft a short, two-minute response that shows faith is not blind belief but reasoned trust based on evidence.

**Guidelines**:
- Keep it under 200 words
- Use a developer analogy
- Be respectful and humble
- Focus on one key point
- End with a question to continue the conversation

**Example Response**:
"I understand why you might think that, but I see faith differently. As developers, we trust systems we can't fully see all the time—cloud infrastructure, third-party APIs, even our own code in production. We don't have perfect knowledge, but we have sufficient evidence to make reasonable decisions.

"Christian faith works the same way. I don't have perfect proof, but I have good evidence—historical accounts of Jesus' resurrection, fulfilled prophecy, and personal experience of God's work in my life. It's not blind belief; it's reasoned trust based on the best evidence available.

"What kind of evidence would you need to consider faith reasonable?"

## Exercise 4: The Evidence Audit

**Objective**: Systematically examine the evidence for your faith.

**Instructions**:
Create a list of evidence that supports your Christian beliefs. Organize it into categories and evaluate the strength of each piece of evidence.

**Categories to Consider**:
- Historical evidence (resurrection, early church, etc.)
- Fulfilled prophecy
- Personal experience
- Logical consistency of Christian doctrine
- Testimony of other believers
- Scientific evidence (fine-tuning, etc.)

**For Each Piece of Evidence**:
1. What is the evidence?
2. How strong is it? (1-10 scale)
3. What are potential objections?
4. How would you respond to those objections?

**Example Entry**:
"Evidence: The resurrection of Jesus
Strength: 8/10
Objections: Maybe the disciples hallucinated or the body was stolen
Response: Hallucinations don't explain the empty tomb, and if the body was stolen, the disciples wouldn't have died for a lie they knew was false."

## Exercise 5: The Conversation Practice

**Objective**: Practice having real conversations about faith and reason.

**Instructions**:
Find a trusted friend, family member, or mentor who is willing to have a practice conversation about faith and reason. Take turns playing different roles.

**Scenarios to Practice**:
1. A skeptical coworker who thinks faith is irrational
2. A fellow Christian who thinks you don't need reason
3. Someone who's genuinely curious about Christianity
4. A person who's been hurt by the church

**Tips for Practice**:
- Listen more than you talk
- Ask clarifying questions
- Find common ground
- Use analogies when helpful
- Be honest about what you don't know
- End with grace and humility

## Exercise 6: The Reading Challenge

**Objective**: Deepen your understanding of faith and reason through study.

**Instructions**:
Choose one of the following books to read over the next month:

**For Beginners**:
- "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis
- "The Case for Christ" by Lee Strobel
- "I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist" by Norman Geisler

**For Intermediate**:
- "The Reason for God" by Timothy Keller
- "Cold-Case Christianity" by J. Warner Wallace
- "The Language of God" by Francis Collins

**For Advanced**:
- "Summa Theologica" by Thomas Aquinas (selected sections)
- "The Existence of God" by Richard Swinburne
- "Warranted Christian Belief" by Alvin Plantinga

**After Reading**:
1. Write a one-page summary of the main arguments
2. Identify which arguments you found most compelling
3. Note any questions or objections you have
4. Share your thoughts with a friend or mentor

## Exercise 7: The Application Project

**Objective**: Apply your understanding of faith and reason to a real situation.

**Instructions**:
Choose one of the following projects to complete over the next month:

**Option A: Workplace Engagement**
- Identify one person at work who might be open to discussing faith
- Look for natural opportunities to share your perspective
- Practice the principles we've discussed
- Journal about your experiences

**Option B: Online Engagement**
- Join a respectful online discussion about faith and reason
- Practice articulating your views clearly and humbly
- Focus on understanding others' perspectives
- Avoid getting drawn into arguments

**Option C: Community Involvement**
- Join a local apologetics group or Bible study
- Volunteer with a ministry that serves skeptics
- Attend a conference or workshop on faith and reason
- Share what you learn with others

## The Bottom Line

These exercises are designed to help you move from theory to practice. Just like learning a new programming language, understanding faith and reason requires both study and hands-on experience.

Start with the exercises that feel most comfortable to you, then gradually challenge yourself with more difficult ones. Remember, the goal isn't to become a perfect apologist overnight—it's to grow in your ability to think clearly and communicate effectively about your faith.

Most importantly, approach these exercises with humility and grace. You're not trying to win arguments or prove yourself right. You're trying to grow in your understanding and help others do the same.
