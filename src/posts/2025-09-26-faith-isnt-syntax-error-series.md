# Faith Isn't a Syntax Error - A Developer's Guide to Faith and Reason

Welcome to a new series exploring one of the most misunderstood aspects of Christianity: the relationship between faith and reason. If you're a developer who has ever felt like you had to choose between thinking logically and believing in God, this series is for you.

## The Problem

Skeptics and critics often assume Christians are simply operating on "blind faith"—believing without evidence, or worse, believing against the evidence. In their minds, faith is the opposite of logic. But some Christians fall into an equal and opposite error. They argue that you don't need reason at all, only faith.

Both views are wrong.

## The Solution

The Bible never paints faith as an irrational leap. Instead, it calls us to love God with our **mind** (Matthew 22:37), to **reason together** with Him (Isaiah 1:18), and to always be **ready to give a defense** (1 Peter 3:15). Far from shutting off our brains, Scripture invites us to think deeply, weigh evidence, and ground our trust in reality.

## What You'll Learn

In this series, we'll explore:

{% for post in collections.seriesPosts %}
{% if post.data.title != "Faith Isn't a Syntax Error - A Developer's Guide to Faith and Reason" %}
{% set isPublished = post.date | isPublished %}
{% if isPublished %}
- **[{{ post.data.title }}]({{ post.url }})** - {{ post.data.description }}
{% else %}
- **{{ post.data.title }}** - {{ post.data.description }} *(Coming {{ post.date | dateReadable }})*
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## The Developer Connection

As developers, we understand this balance intuitively. We work with systems we can't fully see—cloud infrastructure, third-party APIs, complex frameworks. We don't have access to every line of code in the libraries we use, but we trust them because they've proven reliable through testing and real-world use.

This isn't blind trust—it's reasoned trust based on evidence. The same principle applies to Christian faith.

## The Bottom Line

Faith isn't a syntax error in logic—it's reason fulfilled in trust. Biblical faith invites the believer to think deeply, to love fully, and to act confidently on the evidence of God's promises.

Just as you wouldn't deploy code without testing, you shouldn't accept faith without reasoning. And just as you wouldn't let perfect testing prevent you from deploying working code, you shouldn't let the absence of perfect certainty prevent you from trusting in what you know to be true.
